- `date +%T â€“s "16:45:00"` = Manually set time in HH:mm:ss format.
- `date`                   = View current time.

System time     : 0.000126482 seconds slow of NTP time # Difference between host time and NTP server time.
Last offset     : -0.000039551 seconds                 # Changes made during chrony's last modification.
RMS offset      : 0.001020088 seconds                  # Long-term average offset.
Frequency       : 2.941 ppm fast                       # How much faster/slower the default system clock is from NTP server.
Residual freq   : -0.001 ppm                           # Difference between reference frequency and current frequency.

Leap status     : Normal                               # Whether a leap second is pending to be added/removed.
