#### add iso repo to centos
- go to centos.org
- click 'get centos now'
- click 'alternative downloads'
- click 'i386' in the row corresponding to centos version 6
- click any mirror link
- click the iso you wish to download. It will likely be the largest one. Don't download the torrent.
- save it anywhere
- launch the UPT_Dev VM and in the top-left corner of VMWare, click VM -> Removable Devices -> CD/DVD -> Conenct
- navigate to the iso image file you downloaded
- inside the UPT_Dev VM, run 'sudo mount -o /dev/cdrom /[mount location]'
- the disk is now mounted and you can browse the packages
- to turn the packages into a full repo, you need to add the disk ID to the yum configuration. you can do that as follows:
- run 'head -1 /[mount location]/.discinfo'
- copy that number
- run your favorite text editor to open /etc/yum.repos.d/CentOS-Base.repo
- for each repo you'd like to add, next to 'mediaid=' , enter the number you copied
- next to 'baseurl=', enter the path of the mounted disk. For example, if you mounted the disk on /test, the row would read 'baseurl=file:///test'
- run 'yum clean all'
- yum should now recognize the disk as a repository
