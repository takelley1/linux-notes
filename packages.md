1. save it anywhere
1. launch the UPT_Dev VM and in the top-left corner of VMWare, click VM -> Removable Devices -> CD/DVD -> Conenct
1. navigate to the iso image file you downloaded
1. inside the UPT_Dev VM, run 'sudo mount -o /dev/cdrom /[mount location]'
1. the disk is now mounted and you can browse the packages
1. to turn the packages into a full repo, you need to add the disk ID to the yum configuration. you can do that as follows:
1. run 'head -1 /[mount location]/.discinfo'
1. copy that number
1. run your favorite text editor to open /etc/yum.repos.d/CentOS-Base.repo
1. for each repo you'd like to add, next to 'mediaid=' , enter the number you copied
1. next to 'baseurl=', enter the path of the mounted disk. For example, if you mounted the disk on /test, the row would read 'baseurl=file:///test'
1. run 'yum clean all'
1. yum should now recognize the disk as a repository
