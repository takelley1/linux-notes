## PFSENSE

- [Place firewall rules on the interface where the traffic originates](https://blog.monstermuffin.org/pfsense-guide-nat-firewall-rules-networking-101/)

- [<INTERFACE> Net vs <INTERFACE> Address:](https://docs.netgate.com/pfsense/en/latest/firewall/configure.html)
  - Interface Net
    - These macros specify the subnet for that interface exactly, including any IP alias VIP subnets that differ from
      the defined interface subnet.
  - Interface Address
    - These macros specify the IP address configured on that interface.
