## LCD / TFT LCD

*liquid crystal display* [1, 2]  
- works by shining an LED backlight through a crystal structure, which has three polarization filters for producing different levels of red, green, or blue light, based on the voltage applied to it  
- the crystal panel of LCDs can only *block* light, so black pixels are blocked, but the backlight still shines through, causing blacks to appear grey
- panel types  
  - TN (Twisted Nematic)  
    - Pros: fastest refresh rates and response times  
    - Cons: poorest viewing angles, color and contrast  
  - VA (Vertical Alignment)  
    - Pros: best contrast [2], better colors and viewing angles than TN  
    - Cons: poorest refresh rates and response times, ghosting artifacts  
  - IPS (In-Plane Switching)  
    - Pros: best viewing angles and colors  
    - Cons: slower response times than TN, issues with "IPS glow" at screen edges     
- backlight technologies  
  - edgelit - many white LEDs along the edge of the display panel shine inwards  
  - FALD (full array local dimming) - LCD with multiple LED backlight "zones" that can be selectively activated/deactivated, increasing contrast in some cases - the resolution of the backlight zones determines much "glow" is visible on images with sharp edges of contrast, like white text on a black background  
  - mini-LED local dimming - ultra-high resolution local dimming created by extremely small individual white LED backlights, reducing backlight glow and increasing contrast [3]

## OLED

*organic light-emitting diode* [1, 2]  
- each pixel emits its own light, brightness is controlled by the voltage applied to the panel  
- black pixels are completely turned off, allowing for "perfect" contrast  
  - Pros: excellent contrast capable of HDR, colors, and power efficiency, thinner than LCDs  
  - Cons: possible image retention issues, more expensive than LCD

## MicroLED

- each pixel is an individual LED, allowing for nearly all of the benefits of OLED without image retention issues  
- still an emerging technology
